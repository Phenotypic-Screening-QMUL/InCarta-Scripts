# InCarta Scripts
InCarta is high content analysis software that is the go to package in the facility for analysing INCA images. 

Whilst not as customisable as Developer, it provides a user friendly interface and is particuarly powerful at assessing a large range of morphological features.

### InCarta General Use
These provides an overview for generating data analysis using both the summary and single target csv files that InCarta outputs. 

### Multimetric Morpholical Analysis
Guides are also provided for performing multimetric morphological analysis including the generation of heatmaps.

A step by step guide to "senescence-associated morphological phenotypes" is also available.

**Guides for following this code (along with the raw data) are available on the facility Teams Hub in the "04 - Bioinformatics Script Repository" folder.**
